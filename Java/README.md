[Introduction to Breakpoints and Debugging Console (Java)](https://youtu.be/-13xdg-k6c4)

In this video, we'll explore the basics of debugging with Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for Java programming. We'll focus on two fundamental concepts: breakpoints and the debugging console.

Firstly, let's understand breakpoints. These are markers we can place in our code to pause execution at specific points. This allows us to inspect the program's state and behavior at those moments. Setting breakpoints in VSCode is straightforward; just click on the area to the left of your code line number, and a red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint.

Once breakpoints are set, we can run our Java program in debug mode by clicking on the 'Run and Debug' button. When the program reaches a breakpoint, execution pauses, and we can utilize the debugging console to inspect variables and expressions. You can access the debugging console by clicking on the 'Debug Console' tab at the bottom of the VSCode interface.

In the debugging console, we can interact with the program, evaluate expressions, and even modify variables to observe their impact on the program's behavior. These tools are invaluable for identifying and fixing bugs in our Java code, providing us with a deeper understanding of our programs' execution flow and state.
