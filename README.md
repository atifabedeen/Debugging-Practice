# Debugging-Practice

This is a project for CS879. The goal of this project is to teach students debugging skills in VSCode.

The project has 2 versions, Python and Java, in their corresponding directories.

# Intro to Debugging:

Here, using a simple Python script to demonstrate the debugger, you will learn what a debugger is and how to set it up for your project. This tutorial also is useful for other programming languages.

A debugger is a tool in Vscode that is used to execute your code line by line.

It helps you to know what variable are affected and running one line of your code. Traditionally, one can print their value of the variable to console so that they examine the accuracy of the code.

But with a long complex code the traditional way might not be very helpful. Here is where the debugger comes in that regard and it helps you concetrate on specific parts of your code that might cause problem.

In order to access the debugger, on the left side of the screen, look for the "bug" and the running symbol. Once you click on that, it opens a new window.

Then if you click on the "run and debug" option, after a moment, you are in debugging mode.

In the following videos you will learn the concept of "being in the debugging mode" and how you can set up breaking points. Additionallu, you will learn the meaning of commands "continue",  "step over",  "step into" and "step all".
