# Debugging-Practice

This is a project for CS879. The goal of this project is to teach students debugging skills in VSCode.

The project has 2 versions, Python and Java, in their corresponding directories.

hi everyone in this exercise I will be going over what a debugger is and how you can set it up for your coding projects in this tutorial I will be using a simple python script to demonstrate the debugger but you can use it for any Co coding language to start off a debugger is just a simple tool in vs code that you can use to execute your code line by line This is particularly helpful if you want to see how your variables are affected after an execution of a line in your code uh originally you guys might just be printing to console the variables that you want to see and it might help you to figure out what the problems with your code are but if you have a very complex and long scripts that might not be very helpful so the debugger comes in that regard to help you focus and narrow down and figure out uh which parts of your code might be affecting your output to access the debugger you can head over to the left hand side of your window and look for for the bug and the running symbol icon once you click it you will open a window a new window will open up and once you click the run and debug option it will take a moment and you will be in the debugging mode now in the future videos we will be going over what it really means to be in a debugging mode how you can set up breaking points and what these commands on the top which are continue step over step into and step all really mean so that's it for me right now thank you
